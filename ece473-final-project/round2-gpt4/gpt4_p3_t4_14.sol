To fix the code, you may consider using a more stable version of the solidity compiler, such as ^0.8.10 or whichever version is currently deemed stable and doesn't contain the issues pointed out. Replacement of the pragma statement would make the code look like this:  ```solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.10;  contract SimpleContract {     string public message;      constructor(string memory initMessage) {         message = initMessage;     }      function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {         message = newMessage;     } }
